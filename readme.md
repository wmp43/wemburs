# wemburs

Python package built in Rust. Currently only have descriptive statistics developed but will move onto inferential, plotting, outlier detection, visualizations, data preprocessing. I think this will become a personal use package for heavy/slow DS workflows.
## Features
Currenlty implemented:
- Descriptive Statistics: measures of centrality, spread, and shape with a summary statistics function for all of them at once. 

Future implementations:
- Inferential, data preprocessing, dataframe functions, outlier detection, visualizations, etc. Ideas are welcome

### Prerequisites
numpy 

```bash
# installation
pip install wemburs
