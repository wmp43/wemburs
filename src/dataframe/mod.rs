// Functions
// apply_methods: Execute statistical methods on columns of a table-like dataset.
// summarize_data: Generate a snapshot of the main characteristics of each column in the dataset.
// filter_rows: Select rows of the dataset based on specific criteria.
// mutate_columns: Create new columns by transforming or combining existing ones.
// aggregate_data: Group the data and then calculate stats like sum, average, etc., for each group.
// kolmogorov_smirnov_test: Assess if two samples are drawn from the same distribution or compare a sample with a reference probability distribution.
// mann_whitney_u_test: Determine whether there is a difference between two independent groups on a dependent variable, typically used when the data do not meet the assumptions necessary for a t-test.
// wilcoxon_signed_rank_test: Test the difference between pairs of observations to assess changes or differences in their means.
// kruskal_wallis_test: A non-parametric method for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution, used when the ANOVA assumptions are not met.
// fisher_exact_test: Determine if there are nonrandom associations between two categorical variables, used when sample sizes are small.
// pearson_correlation_test: Measure the strength and direction of association between two continuous variables.
// spearman_rank_correlation_test: Assess monotonic relationships between two continuous or ordinal variables without assuming that the relationship is linear.
// factor_analysis: Reduce the dimensionality of data by finding a few unobservable variables (factors) that explain the observed variance.
// principal_component_analysis: Transform the data to a new coordinate system where the greatest variance comes to lie on the first axes.
// log_rank_test: Compare the survival distributions of two samples. Useful in survival analysis and modeling time-to-event data.
// power_analysis: Determine the sample size required for an experiment to identify a significant effect.
// multivariate_analysis: Techniques for analyzing data that involves multiple variables, determining the effect and relationships among them.
